# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Praxis is a full-stack web application designed to help users prepare for technical interviews through two main features: mock questions practice and interactive mock interviews. The application allows users to select companies, roles, and difficulty levels to receive tailored content. Users can practice with company-specific questions or participate in full voice-based mock interview sessions with real-time speech interaction and progress tracking.

3. WHEN a user selects a company THEN the system SHALL display available role options (Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Product Manager, etc.)
4. WHEN a user selects a role THEN the system SHALL display difficulty level options (Easy, Medium, Hard)
5. IF no content exists for a company-role-difficulty combination THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 2

5. WHEN a user completes all questions THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of their responses and suggested improvements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user preparing for interviews, I want to participate in a voice-based mock interview, so that I can practice speaking my answers naturally in a realistic interview setting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

6. IF a user provides an incomplete or unclear answer THEN the system SHALL generate and ask relevant follow-up questions

### Requirement 4
